# Tech Internships (2024)
> Are you a Filipino looking for tech internships inside the Philippines and abroad? You're in the right place!

This repository is inspired by the [`Summer2024-Internships`](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2024-Internships) repository by Simplify and CSC Pitt. 


## ✍️ About this repository
I created this repository out of the frustration I faced while searching for tech internships online. While internships (also called <i>"on the job training"</i> or <i>OJT</i>) are part of the college curriculum in the Philippines, they require a direct communication between one's university and the company one wishes to intern at. Not to mention, OJTs are time-bound, meaning that one is not allowed to take it earlier or later than prescribed in the curriculum. 

As a solution to this problem, I decided to make this repository. I was inspired by the reels I've seen on the developer side of Instagram, and when I found the `Summer2024-Internships` repo by Simplify, I knew that something similar for IT, CS, IS, and adjacent majors would help students like me.

> NOTE: The records on this list are internships that fall outside the OJT period. This means that **you should be eligible to apply for the internships outside your OJT requirements**.
